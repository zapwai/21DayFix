# 21DayFix
21 Day Fix Tracker:

Check it out at http://zapwai.net/diet/d
Uses local (web) storage and Javascript to keep track of a diet.
Need to add an export feature.

Note that the editor edit.html will not work in Safari because of its auto-refresh feature/bug. It will work in other browsers, such as chrome or firefox. (I may fix this at some point, since the point was to keep track of my diet on my phone.)
